		<p class="titles">The diverse mix of commercial property categories</p>
		
		The diverse mix of properties in the commercial market covers everything
		from offices and serviced offices to land for sale and businesses for sale.
		The term, commercial property actually refers to any building or land that
		is used to generated a profit, whether that profit comes from rental income
		or capital gain on the property’s value. Just from this term you can 
		understand how the commercial property market is much bigger than many people
		would think, covering almost every type of conceivable property.

		Many of the categories defined in the commercial market share some overlap
		in their categorisation or order of hierarchy. For example, while office,
		serviced offices and meeting rooms are all separate categories, both serviced
		offices and meeting rooms can be classed as sub categories or children of 
		the office category. By the same token, there are then even more examples 
		if we consider that virtual offices are essentially a sub category of serviced
		offices, leading to a parent, child and grandchild relationship. This occurs 
		in plenty of other categories too, like industrial being a parent in some form
		of warehouse property, yet both markets are big enough to be a property type
		that are in demand and, therefore, deserving of their own classification and 
		categorisation.

		<p class="titles">Commercial property categories and buying</p>
		
		When it comes to buying a commercial property of your chosen category,
		you might find it’s much harder to make a decision than it would be 
		if renting. Typically, the commitment of buying can be a much larger
		investment, and we have therefore provided lots of relevant commercial
		property category information regardless of which type of commercial 
		property you’re interesting in.

		depending on your options. We have a plethora of bespoke information on each 
		category, and if you are considering whether renting or buying is the right 
		option, or what the positive and negative points of buying a commercial property
		at auction are, we should be able to help. Additionally, if you’re planning 
		on buying a business for example, we have information on the advantages and 
		disadvantages of the process of buying, which should help you develop a good
		understanding of what you could stand to gain.

	<div class="article2">
		<p class="titles">Use classes and commercial property categories</p>
		
		All commercial properties are affected by use classes, and whatever category
		of commercial property you’re looking for information on, we should have 
		something suitable for you. Some categories like shops and retail are fairly
		limited in their usage range, so the overall number of relevant use classes
		is relatively low. In other categories like businesses for sale, the sheer 
		variety of properties and businesses covered means that the range of use 
		classes is going to be much greater and more diverse.
